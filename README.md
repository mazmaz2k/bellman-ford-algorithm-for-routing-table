# bellman-ford-algorithm-for-routing-table
We will implement the bellman ford algorithm for routing. Your program will simulate a router, i.e., if there are n routers, you should run it n times in n different terminals. The input to your program is a file that contains the routers information, the name of the router and number of trials to connect to a neighbor router
